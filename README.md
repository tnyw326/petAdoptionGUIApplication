# My Technical Project

## An Application for Animal Adoption

**Description:**

- *What will the application do?*  
 For this technical project in CPSC 210, I am thinking of making an application for animal adoption. Specifically, my goal
is that people are able to adopt animals through this application or post animals for other pet lovers to adopt. 
- *Who will use it?*                 
There will be two groups of users in my application,
the first group would be people who have animals waiting to
be adopted, they can post their animals on the application with relative information. My other group of users would
be people who are interested in adopting animals.

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*
  I am interested in making such a project as I am a pet lover myself, and I have some relative working experience with pets. I have witnessed a lot of pets staying in those "transparent boxes" in the pet adoption center or in local pet supply stores. They have food, water, a place to sleep, and someone that takes care of them but that is not home for them. The wish of this project is therefore to help pets find a lovely home, a place where they can be cared for and loved for their whole life.
