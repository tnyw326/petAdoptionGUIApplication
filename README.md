# My Personal Project

## an Application for Animal Adoption

**Description:**

- *What will the application do?*  
 For my personal project in CPSC 210, I am thinking of making an application for animal adoption. Specifically, my goal
is that people are able to adopt animals through this application. 
- *Who will use it?*                 
There will be two groups of users in my application,
the first group would be people who have animals waiting to
be adopted, they can post their animals on the application with pictures and information. My other group of users would
be people who are interested in adopting animals.

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*     
I am interested of making this project because I love animals and I really want to adopt a dog.
